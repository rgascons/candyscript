# candyscript
Because coffeescript is not enough

What is this?
-------------

Candyscript is a toy language that I'm developing
while I learn more about compilers/interpreters.

What does this language do?
---------------------------
Currently not much, it supports basic operations between numbers
and simple assigns to variables. See examples/simpletest to see
what it can do. I plan to support basic language features
such as strings, boolean algebra, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.

Compile
-------

Just run `npm install` and then `compile.sh`.

Run
---
Execute `node candyscript/candyscript.js --file=examples/simpletest`
or just `node candyscript/candyscript.js` for the command-line version.
